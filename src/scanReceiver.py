""" Class to listen for incoming data from the scanner.

This tool is designed to be run in a separate thread, where it will:
    - establish a socket connection to pynealScanner (which will be sending
    volume data from the scanner)
    - listen for incoming volume data (preceded by a header)
    - format the incoming data, and assign it to the proper location in a
    4D matrix for the entire scan

In addition, it also includes various methods for accessing the progress of an
ongoing scan, and returning data that has successfully arrived, etc.

Notes for setting up:
** Socket Connection:
This tool uses the ZeroMQ library, instead of the standard python socket
library. ZMQ takes care of a lot of the backend work, is incredibily reliable,
and offers methods for easily sending pre-formatted types of data, including
JSON dicts, and numpy arrays.

** Expectations for data formatting:
Once a scan has begun, this tool expects data to arrive over the socket
connection one volume at a time.

There should be two parts to each volume transmission:
    1. First, a JSON header containing the following dict keys:
        - volIdx: within-volume index of the volume (0-based)
        - TR: repetition time for scan (seconds)
        - dtype: datatype of the voxel array (e.g. int16)
        - shape: voxel array dimensions  (e.g. (64, 64, 18))
        - affine: affine matrix to transform the voxel data from vox to mm
        space
    2. Next, the voxel array, as a string buffer that can be converted into a
        numpy array.

Once both of those peices of data have arrived, this tool will send back a
confirmation string message.

** Volume Orientation:
Pyneal works on the assumption that incoming volumes will have the 3D
voxel array ordered like RAS+, and that the accompanying affine will provide
a transform from voxel space RAS+ to mm space RAS+. In order for any mask-based
analysis in Pyneal to work, we need to make sure that the incoming data and the
mask data are represented in the same way. The pyneal_scanner utilities have all
been configured to ensure that each volume that is transmitted is in RAS+
space.

Along those same lines, the affine that gets transmitted in the header for each
volume should be the same for all volumes in the series.
